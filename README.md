# COMP 476 - Assignment 2
Brandon Huang - Winter 2020

A class assignment for Advanced Game Development at Concordia University. The assignment consists of implementing graph traversal algorithms (Dijkstra and A* with different heuristics) with nodes spread out amongst a level as well as implementing AI for the latter, using paths created with the nodes and by using Unity's Navmesh feature. Two different AIs: a chaser and a runner, attempt to respectively capture and outrun the other.

The AI is implemented using Behaviour Tree template code provided by the university. The tree is described in an XML file: Assets/car-behaviour.xml

### Tech used
Unity 3D

### To run the project
Download the project to a local folder.
Open Unity and open the project folder you downloaded to.
Run the game. There is a Switch button that will toggle between graph traversal pathfinding and navmesh pathfinding.
